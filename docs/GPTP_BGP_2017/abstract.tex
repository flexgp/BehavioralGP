We investigate the application of a version of Genetic Programming
with grammars, called Grammatical Evolution, and a multi population
competitive coevolutionary algorithm for anticipating tax evasion in
the domain of U.S. Partnership tax regulations. A problem in tax
auditing is that as soon as an evasion scheme is detected a new,
slightly mutated, variant of the scheme appears. Multi population
competetive coevolutionary algoriothms are disposed to explore
adversarial problems, such as the arms-race between tax evader and
auditor. Furthermore, we use Genetic Programming and grammars to
represent and search the transactions of tax evaders and tax audit
policies. Grammars are helpful for representing and biasing the search
space. The feasibility of the method is explored with an example of
adversarial coevolution in tax evasion. We study the dynamics and the
solutions of the competing populations in this scenario, and note that
we are able to replicate some of the expected behavior.
