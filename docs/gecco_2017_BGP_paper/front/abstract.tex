Intrigued by the importance of subprogram behavior, we investigate how much Behavioral Genetic Programming is sensitive to model bias by asking how important it is that model techniques select different subprograms and differ in how accurately they can regress subprogram behavior on desired outputs. We find no remarkable difference between 2 different decision tree algorithms, REPTree and CART in this regard, though for a modest fraction of our datasets we find one algorithm or the other results in superior error reduction than the other.  We also investigate alternate ways to identify useful subprograms beyond examining those within one program. In an effort to identify subprograms from different programs that work well together, we combine behavioral traces from multiple programs and use the information derived from modeling with it. We find XX.
