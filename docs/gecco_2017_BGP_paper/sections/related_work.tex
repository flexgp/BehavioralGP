BGP is not the only approach to program synthesis, there are e.g. sketching\cite{solar2008program}, i.e. communicating insight through a partial program, generalized program verification\cite{srivastava2010program}, as well as hybrid computing with neural network and external menory\cite{graves2016hybrid}

One extension to the genetic programming paradigm is behavioral
genetic programming (BGP) \cite{krawiecGECCO2014,KrawiecBPS2016}.  BGP attempts to identify
useful subprograms that can then be used to enhance the evolutionary
process. The behaviroal program syhnthesis with Genetic
Programming\cite{krawiec2016behavioral} is investigated, where the
goal is to automatically generate a program that meets some
requirements. E.g. BGP looks at implicit fitness
sharing\cite{mckay2000fitness}, trace consistency analysis, memory in
the form of archives\cite{haynes1997line}. Extension are e.g. Memetic Semantic Genetic
Programming\cite{Ffrancon:2015:MSG:2739480.2754697} compute the
optimal ``shouldbe'' values each subtree should return.

Since its inception\cite{KrawiecSwan} and the introduction of the
trace matrix and demonstration of blah in a system called
PANGEA\cite{krawiec2013pattern} where minimum description length was
induced from the program execution, there have been a variety of
extensions. For example, in the general vein of behaviorally
characterizing a program by more than its accuracy, e.g. when
discovering search objectives for test-based
problems\cite{liskowski2016online}.

The relationship between BGP and Semantic GP is the common goal of
characterising program behaviour in more detail, and exploit this
information. Wheras BGP looks at subprograms semantic GP, where
program output is scrutinized for every test individually, was
initiated by a study of the impact of crossover on program semantics
and semantic building blocks~\cite{mcphee2008semantic}. A survey of
semantic models in GP~\cite{vanneschi2014survey} gives an overview of
methods for operators, as well as different objectives.
