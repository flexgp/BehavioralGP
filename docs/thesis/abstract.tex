In this work I introduce genetic programming as a general technique to produce programs with arbitrary behavior.  I discuss genetic programming and its application the task of symbolic regression.  I introduce behavioral genetic programming as an extension to genetic programming and explore various extensions to it.  The codebase that I build is made sufficiently flexible to easily accommodate future adaptions to the behavioral genetic programming methodology.  I test the performance of the implementation of behavioral genetic programming along with several extensions.
